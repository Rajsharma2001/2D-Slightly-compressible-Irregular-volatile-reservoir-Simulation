[`template.txt`](https://github.com/yohanesnuwara/pyresim/blob/master/input/template.txt) is the input format for PyReSim. 
Input data in TXT file is used as is. Just input the numbers.

```
from input_output import read_data

filepath = '/.../template.txt'
reservoir_input, well, west_boundary, east_boundary, south_boundary, north_boundary = read_input(filepath)
```
⚠️ If the program won't run, make sure that you have:

* Not given spacing between two values in the input. The program is based on delimiter comma `,`, not comma-space.
* Given line spacing between two different variables.

Here is a piece of example.

The correct one (from `template.txt`).

Pay attention to the line spacing between the variable `WELLNAME` is `BLOCK COORD X`. These line spacings are consistent in throughout the files. 

Also pay attention that there is no space between two values. In `WELLNAME`, the values are `A,B,C,D,E`, not `A, B, C, D, E`. 

```
----------------
WELL INPUT
----------------

WELLNAME
A,B,C,D,E

BLOCK COORD X
10,40,10,40,25

BLOCK COORD Y
10,40,40,10,25
```

So this won't run

```
----------------
WELL INPUT
----------------
WELLNAME
A, B, C, D, E
BLOCK COORD X
10, 40, 10, 40, 25
BLOCK COORD Y
10, 40, 40, 10, 25
```

### Important Notes:

* well should be inputed in order based on their block coordinates
