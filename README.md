> This repository is still worked on. However, each week or so, there will be a teaser posted in my LinkedIn, about one reservoir simulation case and how PyReSim is used to solve. It will be scheduled for launch once all simulators have been set up and complete (scheduled in 2021). See my progress bar to keep updated, stay tuned!

## Challenging Case

PyReSim will be performed to a more challenging case. This case is obtained from a "Chapter Project" in *Basic Applied Reservoir Simulation* (Ertekin, Abou-Kassem, King; 2001). In this case, the reservoir geometry is complex (irregular boundary, varied grid size) and reservoir property is heterogeneous. [See more details of this case](https://github.com/yohanesnuwara/pyresim/blob/master/docs/challenge_description.md)

## Contributing to this Work

## Donation

We tirelessly spent days and nights to continuously develop, fine-tune, and improve PyReSim as an open-source Python reservoir simulator program, with the hope that everyone get benefits from. This work is done without direct financial support. If you like (and trust) this work, we would be very glad if you would consider to give us a little gift. Your donation will allow us to spend even more time improving this simulator.
